## with interactive voice commands and clothes coloring detection

##DEMO: : https://youtu.be/9u4jOUY6Wkc
##Presentation: file:///C:/Users/suraj/Downloads/MODEL-converted%20(1).pdf

This Project uses tensorflow / Keras and Other Python ML libraries. (OpenCV, Numpy....)
## Funtionalities
-> Real time Social distancing detection
-> Real time mask detection
-> Voice Commands: eg: ###(Please maintain the social distancing)
-> Cloth color detection: eg: ###(You in Red Colored Clothes, Please wear your mask.

### Used predefined object detection models of Yolo

## Algorithms Used:

1. Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN)
2. K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)

##Use:
(after installing python and useful libraries used in the project
Run: `Main.py`
